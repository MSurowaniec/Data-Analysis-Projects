# Heart Disease Analysis

## Introduction
This project is a comprehensive analysis of a heart disease dataset. The goal is to identify key factors influencing heart disease and demonstrate data analysis and visualization skills.

The analysis is performed in Python using popular data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

## Insights
- Individuals over the age of 60 have the highest prevalence of heart disease.
- Chest pain type (`cp`) and maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`) are significant predictors of heart disease.
- Cholesterol levels, while often considered a risk factor, were not strongly correlated with heart disease in this dataset.
